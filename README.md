# Tankz
This is a simple 3D game where you control a tank and the objective is to destroy all enemies in the scenario. Right in the middle of the scenario there's a wall, on one side there's our tank and on the other side of the wall there are allies and enemies. The allies are represented by green trees and the enemies are represented by red trees. The tank can move in all directions and has two other axes that move independently. The tank can shoot one projectile at a time, it can collide with an ally, an enemie and a wall block. The projectile will be destroyed if it collides with any of these objects or in case it moves further away the scenario limits. The game ends when all the enemies are destroyed. Each object you hit you gain different points, the sum of these points will be your final score. The final score and the points will be shown in the terminal.
